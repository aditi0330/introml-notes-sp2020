## Overview of 525X

This course serves as an introduction to a a **variety** of **foundational principles** in data analytics for **engineering applications**.

Note that terms in **bold**:

* *Variety*: We will introduce a diverse collection of methods for solving challenges in data analysis.

* *Foundational principles*: For every method we study, we will emphasize understanding its fundamental properties: correctness, computational efficiency, potential ways to improve it, etc.

* *Engineering applications*: We will illustrate the efficacy of data analytics methods in the context of how they impact applications related to specific domains, with an emphasis on applications from electrical and computer engineering.

## The science of data processing

Why focus on the *principles* of data processing? And why now?

As of today, data analytics is an off-the-charts "hot" topic. Virtually every scientific, engineering, and social discipline is undergoing a major foundational shift towards more "analytics" oriented.

There are several reasons why this is the case; the foremost being that computing devices and sensors have  pervasively been ingrained our daily personal and professional lives, and that it is easier and cheaper to acquire and process data than ever before. Hence, it is common to hear and read pithy newspaper headlines about data analytics, such as this:

> _"Why data is the new oil."_ (Fortune Magazine, June 2016)

Of course, qualitative claims of this scale must always be taken with a pinch of salt.

It is undoubtedly true that a renewed focus on data-driven analysis and decision making has had considerable impact on a lot of fields. It is also equally true that important questions remain unanswered, and that much of the analysis tools used by practitioners are deployed as "black-boxes".

The only way to place data analytics on a solid footing is to build it bottom-up from the principles upwards; in other words, ask the same foundational questions, as you would for any other scientific discipline.

## What this course is (not) about

This course addresses data analysis from a few different angles (while not exclusively dwelling upon any single one of them):

- machine Learning

- algorithm design

- statistics

- optimization

- "big data" processing

Prior knowledge/experience in any of the above topics will be a plus, but not necessary; the course will be fairly self-contained.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of 525X, we will have:

* become familiar with several commonly used methods for solving data analysis problems:
    - acquisition
    - compression
    - retrieval
    - classification
    - inference
    - visualization
* applied these methods in the context of several data models, including:
    - vectors
    - matrices
    - graphs
* obtained hands-on experience for applying these methods on real-world datasets.

Buckle up!
